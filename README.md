Deals from referrals and repeat customers show the highest win rate, while cold calls underperform.

Average deal closure time is 45 days, with delays mostly in the proposal stage.

# Recommendations

Improve lead qualification process (e.g., better scoring criteria, automation) to reduce early drop-offs.

Provide targeted training & mentoring for underperforming sales reps.

Invest more in referral programs and customer retention strategies.

Streamline the proposal-to-close process with standardized templates and quicker approvals.
