# Insights

Majority of leads drop off at the qualification stage, indicating a gap in lead nurturing.

Top 20% of sales reps contribute to almost 70% of closed deals → performance imbalance.

Deals from referrals and repeat customers show the highest win rate, while cold calls underperform.

Average deal closure time is 45 days, with delays mostly in the proposal stage.

Pipeline shows revenue is heavily concentrated in Q4, creating seasonal dependency.

# Recommendations

Improve lead qualification process (e.g., better scoring criteria, automation) to reduce early drop-offs.

Provide targeted training & mentoring for underperforming sales reps.

Invest more in referral programs and customer retention strategies.

Streamline the proposal-to-close process with standardized templates and quicker approvals.

Spread sales targets more evenly across quarters to reduce over-reliance on Q4.
